# Data-Model-BotsCryOut

This repository presents a data model for creating a "Bots Cry Out" application.

Included in this repository are the following:
  - ER Diagram for a normalized data model
  - ER Diagram code when using DBDiagram
  - SQL query for creating the structure of a database
  - SQL query for inserting data into the database



**ERDiagram**

When looking at the ERDiagram.pdf file you will see four tables presented:
  - Prayers
  - Users
  - Likes
  - Saves

Within these tables are important characteristics that are important in the creation of a normalized database.



**ERDiagram Code**

When looking at the DBDiagram Code file you will see the code for creating an ER Diagram in the DBDiagram tool.



**Structure Code**

When looking at the Structure Code.sql file you will see a lot of information that will create a MySQL Database.

Creating the Database:
  1. Copy the Query.
  2. Open MySQL Workbench.
  3. Open a New Query.
  4. Paste the Database Structure Query.
  5. Execute the script.
  6. Click the refresh button on the left pane.
  7. You will now see a database named botscryout.



**Data Code**

When looking at the Data Code.sql file you will see many lines of code that will add data to your botscryout database.

Adding Data to your Database:
  1. Copy the Query.
  2. Open MySQL Workbench.
  3. Open a New Query.
  4. Paste the Database Data Query.
  5. Execute the script.
  6. Click the refresh button on the left pane.
  7. Right click on a table and select 1000 rows to see your added data.

Congratulations! You have now implemented a data model for creating a "Bots Cry Out" application.
